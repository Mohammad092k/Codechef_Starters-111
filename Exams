Problem
In Chefland, there are 
�
X schools, and each school has 
�
Y students.
The year end results are in and a total of 
�
Z students passed the exams.

Assuming that all students appeared for the exams, find whether the number of students who passed in Chefland was strictly greater than 
50%

--MY CODE

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--){
	    int x,y,z;
	    cin>>x>>y>>z;
	    double t= y*x;
	    t*=(1.0);
	    t= t*(0.5);
	    if(z>t) cout<<"YES"<<endl;
	    else{
	        cout<<"NO"<<endl;
	        
	    }
	}
	return 0;
}
